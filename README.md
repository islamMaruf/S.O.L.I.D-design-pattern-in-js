# SOLID Design Pattern

Learning **SOLID Design Pattern** with javascript

## S - Single Responsibility Principle
One **_class_** should have only one **_responsibility_**.

## O - Open Closed Principle
We can always **_open a class for extention_** but all of it's funtionality must be **__closed for modification__**.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
If we have a function in a class, **_every single child class of that class must use that function and work properly_** .

## I - Interface Segregation Principle
The class that implements interface must use **_every single functionalities of that interface_**.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
High level code do not depend on low level code. We uses a **_abstract layer between high and low level code_**.
